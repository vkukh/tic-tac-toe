# tic-tac-toe
Description

Our game is almost ready! Now let's combine what weâ€™ve learned in the previous stages to make a game of tic-tac-toe that two players can play from the beginning (with an empty grid) through to the end (until there is a draw, or one of the players wins).

The first player has to play as X and their opponent plays as O.
Objectives

In this stage, you should write a program that:

    Prints an empty grid at the beginning of the game.
    Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell coordinates, analyzes the move for correctness and shows a grid with the changes if everything is okay.
    Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.

You need to output the final result at the end of the game.

Good luck!
